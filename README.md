# scouting-app
This is a scouting app made for FRC Team 1280. Currently in beta stages.

Users will have to set up their own database in order to run this code. A MySQL database is recommended, as the PHP MySQLi library was used in this web app. Some parts of the app are not accessible, if you are not logged in. Certain pages will not be available to regular users, since certain pages are restricted for only administrators and captains.

Index.php is the first file you should run as it is the log-in/sign-up page.

The app is still being developed, so do not consider this to be an accurate presentation of what the final app will look like. This is just a basic UI that was put in place in order to test and debug the server-side code.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

*NOTE: The analytics page is purposefully empty. I am collaborating with another teammate on that and it will not be up for some time.*
